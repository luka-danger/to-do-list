# To Do List
## Project 10: To Do List with OOP and SOLID Design 

## Description: 
Welcome to my tenth web development project! This is part of my coursework in The Odin Project, a free, open-source curriculum to learn fullstack web development! 

This project is a dynamic To-Do List application developed with JavaScript and CSS, bundled using Webpack. It features persistent storage, allowing users to save their tasks in local storage for seamless access across sessions.

The application is designed with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and adheres to SOLID principles, ensuring a modular architecture and a focus on single responsibility for each component. This approach promotes efficient code organization and maintainability. Additionally, the app utilizes DOM manipulation to provide an interactive user experience.
